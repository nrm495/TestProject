Using colab in VS code:

Cloudflare releases (download and run the .msi):
https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases
download the .exe as well and rename to cloudflare.exe
when adding the file path to the ssh config file use /path/cloudflared
use the run in terminal option from the colab notebook – password is None
then try opening the repo with the “one click” option in the colab notebook. Password is None

For some reason I only could get this to work by running from the terminal the first time. After that is seemed to work consistently.
You will need to install VS Code extensions on the remote connection, and be sure to select the venv as the Python kernel.
